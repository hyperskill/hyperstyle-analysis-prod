## Stepik and Hyperskill data collection

This module contains client for Stepik and Hyperskill. This educational platforms provides open APIs with information
about platforms' objects.
This module use platforms' APIs to extract information about following entities from educational platforms:

To get data from the education platforms, configure and run [collect_data.py](src/data_collection/api/collect_data.py) 
from command line with following arguments:
### Configure:

1. For platforms api usage you need to create authorize. Create an application in [https://hyperskill.org/oauth2/applications/](https://hyperskill.org/oauth2/applications/) for 
   hyperskill client usage and in [https://stepik.org/oauth2/applications/](https://stepik.org/oauth2/applications/) for stepik:
   * `Client type` --`Confidentional`
   * `Authorization grant type` --`Authorization Code`
   * `Authorization grant type` --`http://localhost:{port}` (by default port 8000, but you can put any and not forget to set it in arguments of run script)
2. After application created you will see your `Client id` and `Client secret`. Set them to environment variables 
   `HYPERSKILL_CLIENT_ID` and `HYPERSKILL_CLIENT_SECRET` for hyperskill or `STEPIK_CLIENT_ID` and `STEPIK_CLIENT_SECRET`.
   
For more information about api go to [hyperskill api documentation](https://hyperskill.org/api/docs/) or [stepik api documentation](https://stepik.org/api/docs/).
   
### Run:
